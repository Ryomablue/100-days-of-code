# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 1st 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up LAMP stack on computer, tested Apache server, created and commited new project repo.

**Thoughts** I never used the LAMP stack and it was super easy to set up. New project has barebones HTML at the moment but was good to code some HTML again.Starting new diet-tracker project
